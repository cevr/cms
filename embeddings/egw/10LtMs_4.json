[{"refcode_short":"10LtMs, Ms 75, 1895, par. 13","refcode_long":"Letters and Manuscripts — Volume 10 (1895), Ms 75, 1895, par. 13","content":"Those who see that loyalty to God will bring about division in the family circle are represented by the man in the parable who said, “I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.” [Luke 14:20.] The supposition that refusing to obey God will bring peace and prosperity to the home, is a delusion of the enemy. Those who sow selfishness will reap selfishness. Christ has sent out an invitation to the gospel feast to all the world. The worst of sinners may share in his abundant salvation. He has made every provision whereby to satisfy the hunger and thirst of the soul; but if those who are invited, refuse to co-operate with God, and if they turn from their Lord and Master, who gave his life in order that they might be blessed in being turned from their iniquities, what is there left for them but to reap the natural results of their sin? They say, It is a vain thing to serve God, and are therefore filled with the fruits of their own doings. They educate themselves to wage controversy with God. They sow to the flesh, and will reap of the flesh corruption. Sowing to the flesh is anything that is opposed to meekness, lowliness, the love of God that is shown by the fulfilling of his law. He who walks after the Spirit does not trust in his own good works nor in himself, but in the Lord Jesus Christ, the divine protection. “In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.” [Isaiah

God’s requirements, whether they will accept the heavenly invitation, or refuse the message requesting their presence at the marriage supper of the Lamb. Christ has died to bring salvation within our reach, and though the very ones to whom we are most closely related, stand in opposition to our loyalty to God, yet we are to consider that Christ has the first claim upon us. The husband may accept the truth, and through the opposing influence of his wife, Satan may work to dishearten and discourage him. The wife seeks to carry out her own desires although they may compel the husband to take a course contrary to what he conscientiously believes to be right; but in order to have peace he swerves from his loyalty to the holy precepts of the Word of God. Through the temptations which his wife presents he is led to yield one point after another, to turn from his straightforward course until his heart is finally won from God. Thus being separated from God, the source of love, it is not surprising that the wife reaps that which she has sown, alienation of the affections of her husband. The man becomes powerless to resist the insinuations of Satan. The wife took great pains to prevent him placing himself where he could walk in the light, and shares with him the wretchedness that results from separation from God. She loses the affection she might have retained, and has succeeded in doing that which she tried to do—to prevent her husband from walking conscientiously in the love of God. He becomes a slave to another’s mind, and is bound by a human will; he turns from Christ who has purchased him with his own blood, loses the companionship of the One whom he should have loved with his whole heart, mind and soul. Having proved untrue to Christ, he is not careful to keep true to his marriage vows. Breaking his allegiance to God does not qualify a man to preserve his love for his wife and
